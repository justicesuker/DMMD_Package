\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of rows of data matrix to be generated}

\item{p}{Number of rows of data matrix to be generated}

\item{rank}{The vector of total ranks of the two matrices to be generated}

\item{rc}{The joint column rank}

\item{rr}{The joint row rank}

\item{nrep}{How many pairs of double-matched matrices that you want to generate?}

\item{std1}{The standard deviation of the first Gaussian noise matrix}
